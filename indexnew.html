      <h2>What is Peak<span style="color: var(--gold)">CY</span>?</h2>
      <p>
        Peak<span style="color: var(--gold)">CY</span> is a social club for people in the Protaras / Famagusta area who want more than small talk.
        We connect ambitious, open, team-oriented people who like to socialize, learn from each other, and explore Cyprus together.
      </p>
      <p>
        There wasn’t a real community hub here, just lots of individuals looking for their crowd.
        We’re bridging that gap with real meetups, real friendships, and a culture of “sharing is caring.”
