    <div class="container">
      <h2>What is Peak<span class="brand-cy">CY</span>?</h2>
      <p>
        Peak<span class="brand-cy">CY</span> is a social club for people in the Protaras / Famagusta area who want more than small talk.
        We connect ambitious, open, team-oriented people who like to socialize, learn from each other, and explore Cyprus together.
      </p>
      <p>
        There wasn’t a real community hub here — just lots of individuals looking for their crowd.
        We’re bridging that gap with real meetups, real friendships, and a culture of “sharing is caring.”

        <li><strong>Fitness together:</strong> member-led sessions for bonding and sweat (many of us train hard and care about health).</li>
        <li><strong>Mastermind dinners (soon):</strong> once the core is solid, we’ll run themed nights and guest masterclasses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted compact">
        We meet monthly, in person, to grow closer, climb higher, and build something real.
