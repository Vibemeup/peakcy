      <h2>What is PeakCY?</h2>
      <p>
        PeakCY is a social club for people in the Famagusta / Protaras area who want more than small talk.
        We connect ambitious, open, team-oriented people who like to socialize, learn from each other, and explore Cyprus together.
      </p>
      <p>
        There wasn’t a real community hub here — just lots of individuals looking for their crowd.
        We’re bridging that gap with real meetups, real friendships, and a culture of “sharing is caring.”

    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Vibe & Values</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Good vibes first:</strong> relaxed, supportive, adventurous, easy-going.</li>
        <li><strong>Networking beyond business:</strong> meet people who share your lifestyle, gym habits, and interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Give & receive:</strong> share what you know (fitness, health, lifestyle, business) — we all rise together.</li>
        <li><strong>Curated membership:</strong> invite-only with member vouching to keep it real and high-quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Local pride:</strong> rooted in Cyprus — beaches, mountains, Mediterranean life. We rep our island.</li>

  <!-- ACTIVITIES -->

    <div class="container">
      <h2>What We Actually Do</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Casual meetups:</strong> bars, cafés, family/kid-friendly hangs, and dinners.</li>
        <li><strong>Outdoors:</strong> hikes, mini-trips, and guided days out across Cyprus (we have a pro guide in the group).</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness together:</strong> member-led sessions for bonding and sweat (many of us train hard and care about health).</li>
        <li><strong>Mastermind dinners (soon):</strong> once the core is solid, we’ll run themed nights and guest masterclasses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Rhythm: one anchor meetup per month — with spontaneous extras if people want more.

  <section id="members" class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Who Fits Here</h2>
      <p>
        Typically 30–50, entrepreneurial or entrepreneurial-minded (from Airbnb rentals and coaching to supplements, fitness, or AI),
        goal-oriented, social, and team-spirited. If you like to <em>give</em> as much as you get — you’ll feel at home.

  <!-- WHY DIFFERENT -->
  <section id="why" class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What Makes PeakCY Different</h2>
      <p>
        We’re not a course funnel or an upsell machine. Just real people helping each other rise — socially, personally, and professionally.
        No fluff. No pressure. Community first.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        <strong>Curated, not random:</strong> applications + vouching keep the culture strong.

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->

    <div class="container">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Apply:</strong> tell us who you are, what you do, and what you want to bring/gain.</li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> we keep it small and high-quality; members can vouch for friends.</li>
        <li><strong>Join:</strong> after approval, you’ll get invited into the group and upcoming meetups.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="muted">
        We start local in Cyprus — with future collabs (gyms, restaurants, hotels) and trips as the community grows.
